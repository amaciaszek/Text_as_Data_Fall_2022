In the fall of 2021, I decided to pursue a certification in Computer Aided Design from MassBay Community College, wrapping it up at the end of the 2022 spring semester. That spring semester, I also decided to finally pursue a masters in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science, something I had been thinking about for quite some time.\nPost undergraduate degree, I worked as a Processing Supply Chain Leader at a PepsiCo plant in Randolph, MA for a year before moving on to my current workplace, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA. Since starting at BIDMC, my role has been primarily that of Office Engineer working for their Facilities department. However, toward the beginning of the pandemic, I was shifted to a new role, N95 Mask Sterilization & Distribution Lead, in the Operations department to fill a workforce need within the organization. That position is what sparked my interests in data analytics and I hope to pursue a DA career within the healthcare/related industry come graduation."

    "text": "##BLOG POST I\n##Broader Research Interest\nI am broadly interested in studying about the social media activism. Specifically, I am interested in examining the following questions: What type of messages (positively charged emotions vs. negatively charged emotions) can promote social change? Are there any differences in who (activists from disadvantaged groups vs.  advantaged groups) can express a particular type of message?\n##Literature Review\nI have reviewed the following papers that have provided me with insights into my area of research:\nMy Fight or Yours: Stereotypes of Activists From Advantaged and Disadvantaged Groups (Burrows et al. 2021):\nThis paper examines to illustrate the stereotypes that are associated with activists across social movements. They hypothesized that activists’ group status – whether they are a member of the advantaged group or the disadvantaged group – will influence the way activists are perceived in society. They used qualitative coding to identify the presence of stereotypes that are used to describe the activists of each group. They found that activists from disadvantaged groups are viewed as emotional and reactive, and activists from advantaged groups are viewed as altruistic and superficial. In my opinion, this was an interesting study, and I would like to examine the social media content of activists from both groups to see whether their content fits the stereotypes listed in this paper.\nA sentiment analysis of the Black Lives Matter movement using Twitter (Peng et al. 2022): This paper examined public reactions to the BLM movement. The researchers used ‘sentiment analysis’ on the Twitter data to explore these public reactions. Additionally, they used retweet frequency and word count frequency to highlight important sentiments of people towards the BLM movement. They found that the BLM movement was received positively as there were a great proportion of tweets supporting the movement. The negative sentiment was associated with the deaths of black people.\nIn my opinion, this was an interesting study understanding multiple sentiments revolving around the movement. I want to extend this study to measure the differences in the way a social message is received dependent on one’s group membership.\n##Specific Questions of Interest\nI want to study the tweets of both Black and White activists to highlight \nthe sentiments used to promote social change. I want to compare the emotions \nof the tweets of Black and White activists on a Black movement and measure\nthe conditions that lead to more retweets. Borrowing the stereotypes from \nBurrows et al. (2022) paper, I want to examine if the content of the social\nmedia messages of the activists are aligned with the stereotypes attached \nto their activist identity, and how this alignment or misalignment affects \nsocial change (which I would like to measure through retweets). \nI aim to scrape Twitter data and use techniques \n(sentiment analysis, word frequency, and retweet frequency) \nlike the Peng et al. (2022) paper.\nFor now, I am thinking of performing the following research steps: 1. List the categories from Burrows et al (2022) used to describe activists. 2. Map these categories to the content found in activists’ tweets. 3. Additionally, do sentiment analysis on the content of the tweets. 4. Measure word frequency of categories for Black and White activists’ tweets"

    "title": "Blog Post 1: Literature Review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Literature Review and Research Questions\nUnderstanding the language used by leaders to discuss important social insight can give us insight into priorities and perspectives of leaders, and how these might vary across different contexts. Further, the ways that leaders talk about issues can guide public opinion.\nAnother global challenge that is currently facing us and which requires cooperation across borders is climate change. Serious climate change impacts are occurring or will soon occur, such as increased extreme weather events, forced migration and displacement, and sea level rise (IPCC, 2021). Given these impacts, and the need for widespread efforts to mitigate these impacts through reductions in GHG emissions, understanding how world leaders think about climate change could be useful to make sense of responses. One forum where many leaders gather to discuss these issues are the United Nations Climate Change conference, which serve as the Conference of Parties (COP) conventions.\nThese annual conferences began in 1995, three years after numerous countries had joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC, retrieved Sep 2022). These meetings bring together world leaders to assess the state of affairs of climate change, and to make decisions that will encourage or enforce climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In 1997, the conference resulted in adoption of the Kyoto Protocol which was developed as a way for countries to commit to various goals aimed at mitigation of climate change through agreed upon limits on GHG emissions. The Kyoto Protocol first went into effect in 2008. In 2015, the COP adopted the Paris Agreement, which was intended to have countries agree to stricter limits and more drastic actions to prevent global warming greater than 2 degrees Celsius. The attendees of these meetings include governmental representatives from the 200+ countries that are party to the convention, along with ‘observers’ who are representatives of intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations. During the proceedings, negotiations over targets and timelines are made over the course of two weeks. Outcomes of the conferences include agreements on targets/limits, guidelines for assessment and reporting of progress, and decisions on how funds should be allocated.\nPast work has used computational and non computational methods to examine media and public responses to COP conferences (e.g., Esparcia & Gomez, 2021; Chen & Jia, 2022; ). For example, Esparcia & Gomez (2021) analyzed features of journalistic content from american media outlets that publish news with some form of polarization. They identified differences between these types of sources in reporting on COP25, with right-leaning sources being more likely to publish articles framed around denial (e.g., attempts at discrediting climate scientists). Left-leaning publications were less likely to publish stories on the climate strikes which occurred, and were more likely than right-leaning publications to include news about fossil and energy industries or climate change impacts (Esparcia & Gomez, 2021). In work comparing media responses in China and the U.S., Chen & Jia (2022) conducted lexical and discourse analysis of news articles published about COP26. They found that U.S. articles more frequently included direct quotations as compared with Chinese news media who tend to use more indirect or partial statements. Further, U.S. articles were more likely than Chinese articles to include mention of President Xi Jingping, and that this was often in the context of mentioning his absence from the conference. Another study which used content analysis of journalist’s tweets from COP25 calculated engagement with tweets in relation to the tweet’s content and author, finding that tweets with negative sentiments, which contained only text, or which were from journalists tended to garner the greatest engagement (Polaino et al., 2021).\nAnother way that these COP meetings have been studied is through analysis of speeches given during the conferences. Ahmed(2022) analyzed the types of metaphors used in speeches given by African and European leaders at COP26 through qualitative analysis of 10 speeches from each continent. Through this analysis, Ahmed discovered some differences in propensity to use certain types of metaphors among European and African leaders. While European leaders spoke about climate change as a war/conflict, a stock market, and doomsday, African leaders spoke about how facing climate change is a journey, how nature is human, and how dealing with climate change is building a project. In other contexts, speeches made by leaders have been analyzed for different types of information and comparisons. For example, one analysis of speeches made by leaders during the pandemic revealed common themes discussed across countries, such as discussion of the economy, but variation was also observed, for example in gender differences of the frequency of discussion of social welfare and vulnerable populations (Dada et al., 2021). However, these studies were limited in the number of speeches that they analyzed, likely because they used human-powered approaches to analyzing these speeches.\nIn the current project, I aim to study how the lexicon of speeches and statements delivered at COP conferences has shifted over time and varies by features of the speaker (e.g., nationality, role, demographics…). Speeches, statements, and other forms of documents are available at the UNFCC website archives. These are published in pdf formats, and there are ~500 published speeches that I saw at first search attempts. Some potential topics I’d like to explore include:\n-“climate change vs. global warming”: Over time, there have been shifts in the language used by scientists, media, and the public to discuss climate change (e.g., use of global warming -> climate change -> climate emergency/crisis).\n-“mitigation vs. adaptation”: I want to examine whether there has been a shift in terms relating to mitigation vs. adaptation. Although initial COP conferences were heavily focused on setting targets for reduced carbon emissions (i.e., mitigation), there is a growing recognition of the need for adaptation to climate impacts, as these are already occurring. On the other hand, I might expect there to be less discussion of adaptation because while mitigation requires global cooperation, many adaptation efforts are carried out at local levels (and must be due to geographical variation in climate impacts)\n-“resilience”: I am also interested in whether ‘resilience’ as a concept has changed in popularity over time, or if it is favored by certain countries but not others.\n-“denial/skepticism vs. science”: I am also interested in whether there is discussion of climate skepticism or denial and if so, how much these ideas are emphasized (i.e., the need to address public skepticism of climate science). There has also been a history of the COP meetings and more generally the UNFCC being criticized for not listening to scientists, although that has changed in recent years as more input from the IPCC has been integrated into proceedings.\n-“hope” and other emotions: are world leaders discussing climate change using personal, emotional language or experiences? How much is the concept of “hope” discussed\n-“technosalvation”: one of the psychological barriers to climate action (Gifford, 2011) is the idea that we can be saved by technology. How much is technology discussed as the solution to climate change in the context of COP speeches?\n-top-down vs. bottom-up: there is a debate in how climate change should be addressed: through individual (bottom-up) action or through the implementation of policies/regulations from the top-down. By its nature, the convening of the UNFCC represents bringing together leaders who have the potential power to implement top-down changes, but I wonder if there is discussion of the need for individual behavior change?\nReferences: Ahmed, M.

I will name a few of them below but without these factors the efficiency and wealth of a team may be wasted. “Conclusively, this study revealed that many English football clubs achieved pure technical efficiency during the period researched, displaying similar managerial skills. Meanwhile, scale effects differentiate the football clubs, some clubs displayed scale efficiencies and others could not. Hence, the scale is the main issue in football management. Thus, it could be concluded that the competitive imbalance among EPL clubs is a result of different scales of operation.” (Badmus, 2019).\n\nManagerial Skills\nExperience\nTactics\n\n\n\nDifferentiating the Top English Premier League Football Clubs\n\nHere we are able to analyze some outcomes from this research and we are able to determine that the top 4 teams tended to perform on a higher level. They were more efficient on the field and we can see the trend of having a higher pass completion percentage tends to lead to more points. Statistically, the top four teams performed on a higher level with an all around higher average. There were certain teams that performed better than the top four teams in certain categories but unfortunately that was not enough to bridge the gap on the other aspects.\n\n\n\nMy thoughts\nThese research articles were two interesting takes on the English Premier League which have inspired me to think more analytically about the league. Utilizing the quantitative and qualitative data to draw out information pertaining to which team is the most efficient is an interesting idea. I love being able to see the visual representation of the data which allows us to quickly draw conclusions from. For example, the image above show the pass completion percentage in relation to points earned within a season. We are able to see a nice trend of higher pass completion typically relates to more points in a season. These studies also conducted sound statistical analysis to draw forth conclusions regarding this data. One interesting point that was noticed is that the more efficient team is not always the one winning the match nor finishing higher in the league which leaves more variables to be examined. This will lead into my research question and my study which will touch base on the mental state of players from each team as the season progresses."

    "text": "Academic articles\n\nArticle 1: Gender Bias in the News: A Scalable Topic Modelling and Visualization Framework\nAuthors: Prashanth Rao and Maite Taboada\n\nResearch question\nRao and Taboada aimed to study how often men and women are quoted in news articles (2021). They looked into different types of articles including sports, lifestyle, business and healthcare, to see if there was a difference in which gender was quoted in these topics.\n\n\nData\nThe data was from the Gender Gap Tracker Data; which scrapes data from seven major English Canadian newspapers’ websites. The data was taken for two years starting from October 2018. A total of 612,343 articles were used (Rao & Taboada, 2021).\n\n\nMethods\nIn order to analyse the data, first the data about the people mentioned as well as the people quoted was taken into account. The gender of the speaker was determined based on a “cache of commonly quoted public figures” and an API which had the gender stored based on the person’s full or first name. The people who were quoted were a subset of the people mentioned and if they were quoted multiple times within the same article, their name was only counted once. The authors did acknowledge that this process limited the genders to a binary and could not take other genders into account. The authors utilised topic modelling with the Apache Spark’s parallel Latent Dirichlet Allocation in Python. The preprocessing steps included tokenisation, normalisation, lowercasing, stopword removal and lemmatisation. Tokenisation and normalisation removed the symbols and artifacts that were not required. Stopword removal removed common words that are not useful for interpretation. Lemmatisation looked at if the tokens were present in a dictionary of lemmas They also used the language analyses of keyness and dependency bigrams (Rao & Taboada, 2021).\n\n\nFindings\nIn general, it was found that in the Lifestyle, Entertainment, Arts and Healthcare categories, women were quoted more whereas for the topics of Business, Sports and United States Politics, men were quoted more often. Men were more likely to be quoted in high-profile articles and women were more likely to be quoted in low-profile articles. Two aspects I found it interesting in the study was that the authors looked into the type of information that was reported for men and women and also how the type of news articles reported corresponded to particular events. For men’s sports, there were descriptions of the events whereas for women’s sports, their achievements were focused upon. In the business section, the male corpus had bigrams such as stocks and trading but the male corpus had small transactions, shopping and small or local businesses. Finally, it was seen that information about women’s and trans’ rights tended to be more in the news in February and March (both in 2019 and 2020). This corresponds to the date of International Women’s day in March (Rao & Taboada, 2021).\n\n\n\nArticle 2: Semi-Supervised Topic Modeling for Gender Bias Discovery in English and Swedish Authors: Hannah Devinney, Jenny Bjorklund and Henrik Bjorklund\n\nResearch question\nDevinney et al. looked into whether there is gender bias in English and Swedish newspaper articles and English web content (2020).\n\n\nData\nThere were three corpora in total: Mainstream English news articles, Mainstream Swedish articles and LGBTQ+ web content in English. Both the mainstream English and Swedish articles were collected from 2019 whereas the web content was collected for five weeks between January and February 2020 (Devinney et al., 2020).\n\n\nMethods\nThey used quantitative as well as qualitative methods. I will focus on the quantitative methods utilised. Semi-supervised topic modelling was used and the topic models were trained with two sets of seed words for fifteen topics. This was done to check for differences in the words and concepts that women, men and nonbinary are linked to. The parallel semi-supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for topic inference. Additionally, they trained one baseline, unsupervised topic model for all three corpora in order to find out if there were any implicitly-gendered topics. The preprocessing steps included tokenisation, lemmatisation and POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging in English corpora (Devinney et al., 2020).\n\n\nFindings\nIn the mainstream corpora, it was found that the words included in the masculine seed lists were present more than the words included in the neutral seed lists and two times more frequently than the words in the feminine seed list. On the other hand, in the queer web content corpora, there was a better balance of the words from all the gender seed lists; there was also more detailed non-binary representation as words such as ze, xe, nonbinary, enby and genderqueer were also found. In all three corpora, the feminine topics were linked to the private sphere whereas the masculine topics were linked to the public sphere. There were some variations in the masculine topics among the mainstream English corpora, mainstream Swedish corpora and Queer web content corpora. In the mainstream English corpora, there are more neutral terms used in the articles in the public sphere. Essentially, men are generalised as neutral. On the other hand, in the Mainstream Swedish corpora, most of the masculine topics were associated with crime and death or Christianity (Devinney et al., 2020)."

This was an online archive I was able to find that has American newspapers: https://guides.loc.gov/consumer-advertising-great-depression/databases-and-archives\n\nIn India, the Times of India and The Hindu are popular newspapers.

    "text": "While I do not know much about text as data, I look forward to understanding it more! In order to try and understand text as data more, I plan to use social media as a tool to gather a large amount of text. I currently plan to use both Reddit and Twitter to gather the text. My current research idea is based on mining text for a reality TV dating show.\n\n\nBelow there are three academic articles that I found to be useful for my research idea.\n\nTwo articles about text as data with social media\nCharacteristics and demographics of people who watch reality dating shows\n\n\n\nThis article by Urszula Świerczyńska-Kaczor focuses on providing insights about how viewers felt out of three movie genres: suspense, westerns, and comedies. This article also would like to provide evidence that “traditional” research can benefit from other disciplines such as consumer neuroscience.\n\n\nThe research question is what kind of viewer experience, based on the three selected genres (suspense, westerns, and comedies), can be seen through text mining of online reviews?\nA second layer to this question was does text mining of online reviews reflect that some movie genres viewer’s have more similar views than other movie genres?\n\n\n\nThe data came from August 2019, with reviews being randomly sampled from both Rotten Tomatoes and Amazon.\nFor the reviews:\n\n624 reviews of “Psycho” (1960).\n806 reviews of “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” (1966).\n600 reviews of the first season of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” (2000).\nThe distributions of “stars” in the sample give a general evaluation of the movie based on both sites.\nOnly English language reviews were included.\nReviews were analyzed without considering how the movie was watched (DVD, TV, streaming, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not outwardly mentioned, the author did seem to believe there would be some connection to certain genres having people perceive the movie similarly.\n\n\n\nBoth the qualitative and quantitative analyses used Statistica software and KH Coder software.\nViewer’s experiences were also analyzed by manual text analysis of 50 reviews of each movie.\n\n\n\nOverall findings include:\n\nThere is a broad spectrum of factors that impact viewers experiences with all three movie genres.\nThe analysis had “general factors” relevant to all genres such as viewer’s expectations for the genre and main characters of the movie.\n\nA surprise category was a viewer’s experience of a historical event seen with reviews of “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall I found this article extremely useful to understanding how to use text as data in a way that focuses on reviews. I also enjoyed learning more about how they broke out reviews by hand by “main topic” and “sub topic”.\nI do wish the author had picked a couple more movie genres. I would’ve been interested to see if a romance movie has any similarities to a thriller for example. I also would’ve liked to see the top 20 words of importance as the first five words for each category weren’t surprising (for example “Psycho” had movie, psycho, hitchcock, classic, and watch).\n\n\n\nŚwierczyńska-Kaczor, Urszula. (2019). Exploring the relationship between viewer experience and movie genre–a study based on text mining of online movie reviews. Problemy Zarządzania, (5/2019 (85)), 154-175.\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Luis Moßburger, Felix Wende, Kay Brinkmann and Thomas Schmidt explores Reddit (r/depression) and Twitter (Beyond Blue) focusing on depression. Brinkman & et al. use various text mining techniques to figure out how language (such as positive or negative words) are different between the two social medias.\n\n\nThe research question is how do Reddit and Twitter differ in people’s language of posting or tweeting on depression?\n\n\n\nData was collected from Beyond Blue (using Python’s standard libraries lxml and urllib) and r/depression (using Pushshift.io API Wrapper psaw and the Python Reddit API Wrapper praw)\nFor Beyond Blue (non-profit organization funded by Australian governments and states)\n\nHad a noticeably smaller corpus than r/depression.\n28,422 posts were collected.\n\n3,922 are initial posts (13.8%) of threads.\n24,500 are answers inside threads (86.2%).\n\n\nFor r/depression\n\n1,007,134 posts (submission and comments) were collected\n\n2,295 posts were filtered due to lack of content.\n158,638 posts were not used due to the posts being deleted by the author, moderators, or spam filters.\n846,201 posts consisting of 131,073 submissions (15.5%) and 715,128 comments (85.5%) were the end use.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrinkman & et al.’s do not focus on having a hypotheses at the beginning of this article (they are more interested in descriptive and exploitative work). However they want to explore methods and data to formulate potential hypotheses for future works.\n\n\n\nThe authors used text mining methods, such as word frequencies, topic modeling, word categories, and word sentiment.\nThe authors used SpaCy (Python) for a general corpus analysis.\nThe Beyond Blue Corpus:\n\nHad 4,982,391 tokens divided among 395,544 sentences with an average of 175.3 tokens per post on average.\nThere is a noticeable difference between the average token counts of initial posts and answers.\nThe average token count of a sentence is 12.6.\n\nr/depression:\n\nHad 60,632,208 tokens within 5,369,000 sentences with 71.7 tokens on average.\nAn average token count of a sentence is 11.3 tokens.\n\nFor word frequencies:\n\nAll stop words and tokens that were not tagged as a noun were removed.\nThe most common word in Beyond Blue and r/depressions was “time”. Other often used words were “day”, “year”, and “depression”\n\nFor word categories words were split into language categories using the LIWC dictionary. Once the categories were created the authors then used VADER ( a lexiconbased sentiment analysis tool specifically used with social media sentiments).\n\n\n\nSentiment\nBeyond Blue\nr/depression\n\n\n\n\nPositive\n40.20%\n34.49%\n\n\nNeutral\n34.42%\n34.20%\n\n\nNegative\n25.38%\n31.32%\n\n\n\nFor topic modeling the authors created a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model with the Python library gensim. This included removing posts with less than five tokens, removing stop words, removing topics created.\nThere is a github link with more information here: https://github.com/lauchblatt/OnlineDepressionForumsTextMining\n\n\n\nOverall findings included that Beyond Blue (Twitter) users were more positive to each other. Beyond Blue general spoke about more adult topics compared to r/depression who spoke about high school and college issues. The authors hypothesize that the professional curation and moderation of a depression forum is positive for discussion that happen in them.\nThe authors also concluded that Beyond Blue focused on concrete problems are solved compared to r/depression’s emotional posts that focused on sharing experiences or conversing about emotions.\n\n\n\nOverall this was an interesting article! I thought the difference between Reddit and Twitter was quite different than what I thought it would be. I have browsed through both, perhaps more on subreddit’s that are created for a female base, I often find Reddit to be the more problem solving and Twitter to be more emotional. However since the article was comparing to a non profit Twitter this may cause for more professionalism needed.\nI found this article very helpful to understanding text as data in a bit more detail. Unfortunately the article used Python rather than R, so the packages were unfamiliar to me.\n\n\n\nMoßburger, Luis, Wende, Felix, Brinkmann, Kay and Schmidt, Thomas (2021) Exploring Online Depression Forums via Text Mining: A Comparison of Reddit and a Curated Online Forum. Proceedings of the Fifth Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop & Shared Task, pp. 70-81.\n\n\n\n\nIn this article by Jonathan W. Roberti, Roberti focuses on understanding the personality characteristics and attachment styles of individuals who watched reality dating tv shows.\n\n\nThe research questions were what are the demographics, personality characteristics, and attachment styles of individuals that watch Television (TV) dating shows? What are the motives for watching these shows?\n\n\n\nData was collected through an internet survey. The convenience sample size was 601 participants with 413 who watched TV dating shows.\n\n\n\nRoberti broke down their research questions into four categories\n\nDo demographic characteristics differ between individuals that do and do not view television dating shows? While there is some suspicion younger viewers are interested in viewing these types of shows, Roberti notes there is a lack of prior empirical findings.\nWhat are the motives for viewing television dating shows? Roberti’s hypotheses on this includes increasing stimulation by watching the show, building a habit around watching the show, escapism, and social learning.\nDo differences in adult attachment styles or personality characteristics occur for individuals that do and do not view television dating shows? There has been previous findings that that those watching TV dating shows have a higher sensation-seeking scores.\nDo television dating shows influence perceptions about dating and relationships? Roberti had no hypothesis for this question.\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously the convenience sample was collected through an internet survey. This included:\n\n155 males (25.8%) and 446 females (74.2%).\nThe mean age of males was 30.0 (SD=7.7) and the mean age of females was 28.0 (SD=8.9).\nA response rate of 87%.\n\nAs this survey was done in 2007, Roberti was able to contact various websites to put their survey hyperlink on the main page of the websites contacted.\nThe survey was at most 10 minutes and contained five sections:\n\nDemographic questions,\nQuestions related to television dating shows\nRelationship Questionnaire (RQ)\nSensation Seeking Scale (SSS-V)\n\nAdditionally participants were not forced to answer every question. Most questions used a Likert scale.\n\n\n\nThe findings included:\n\nDemographics: Although the survey was done by predominantly Caucasians, the survey found a significant amount of participants who watched TV dating shows were younger females. Additionally participants that had some schooling after high school were more likely to watch as well.\nMotive for watching: Roberti found that the top three reasons for watching TV dating shows were Excitability, Social Learning, and Escape. Excitability and Escape significantly predict weekly hours of watching TV dating shows.\nViewing Practices and Opinions on TV dating shows: Participants who watched TV dating shows tended to watch significantly more TV than those who didn’t. Additionally participants that watched TV dating shows believed the shows had a positive influence on wanting to be married and that the shows represented real-life relationships. Participants also wished to be on TV dating shows more than those who did not watch them.\n\n\n\n\nOverall the findings were nothing too different to what I expected. From what I’ve seen on Twitter and heard in person, females are often more likely to watch these shows.\nWhat I did find interesting though was that participants found TV dating shows to be a positive influence on wanting to get married. It also surprised me that participants believed that these relationships were fairly accurate to real-life relationships. When I’ve heard people talk about these shows it’s often for how ridiculously dramatic the shows are.\n\n\n\nJonathan W. Roberti (2007) Demographic Characteristics and Motives of Individuals Viewing Reality Dating Shows, The Communication Review, 10:2, 117-134, DOI: 10.1080/10714420701350403\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy current research idea is to understand how people who watched Love is Blind Japan felt about the contestants and their relationships. From my very limited knowledge text as data can help by:\n\nGoing through multiple tweets and Reddit posts to find posts that mention the contestants names.\nSee how often names were mentioned throughout the show.\nHelp to compare what types of words were used in association with the contestant.\nHelp to see how many contestants names are mentioned together.\n\nThis may include seeing if there are positive or negative feelings. However from our class reading I know that it may be more difficult to do. I know there are multiple packages that categorize words into positive, negative, and neutral words, however I don’t know how accurate they are.\n\n\nMy current research question is: Do Reddit and Twitter differentiate on their views of contestants and their relationships in Love is Blind Japan?\nA different research question I may use if I only use one social media platform: How does Reddit/Twitter view contestants and their relationships in Love is Blind Japan?\nI will gather tweets from Twitter with the hashtag #loveisblindjapan and the phrase “love is blind japan”. I will gather posts from Reddit with the sub Reddit r/loveisblindjapan”.\n\n\n\nSome issues that may come up are:\n\nIs there enough data? While I have looked at both Reddit and Twitter and feel there is enough data, the data may be lopsided one way or another.\nDoes each contestant have enough data? Often more problematic contestants are talked about more than others. Will this cause an issue in finding significance?\nDo I want to focus on how people felt about the show or the contestants? This is a crucial question as each one would involve a different analysis. I’m currently leaning towards the contestants as I believe there will be more data.\nHow do I want to handle couples? As this is a reality dating show, how would I decide to show both names? Do I want to see how couples are seen? This would also include friendship posts as well.\nDo I want to use both Reddit and Twitter? While it seems smart to have both social media platforms, due to the class’s semester I man be unable to. This will have to be decided on after seeing how long the data would take to clean and edit."

    "text": "Mental Health Treatment Among Adults: United States\nThis article comes from the CDC’s website under the National Center for Health Statistics section for mental health. The main research questions include: What percentage of adults have received any mental health treatment varied by age group, are men or women more likely to receive mental health treatments, does the percentage of adults who had received any mental health treatment vary by urbanization level and what percentage of a demographic received the highest amount of mental health treatments. Data from the 2019 NHIS (National Health Interview Survey) were used for this analysis in this article .NHIS is a nationally representative household survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. The NHIS, conducted by NCHS, is the major source for high-quality data used to monitor the nation’s health. Methods that were used to evaluate the trends of adult mental health treatments were orthogonal polynomials in logistic regression. Important findings include as follows: 19.2% of adults had received any mental health treatment in the past 12 months, Women were more likely than men to have received any mental health treatment, Non-Hispanic white adults (23.0%) were more likely than non-Hispanic black (13.6%) and Hispanic (12.9%) adults to have received any mental health treatment and as the level of urbanization decreased, the percentage of adults who had taken medication for their mental health increased. After reviewing this article I believe that using survey data that is based on mental health would be a interesting project because there are tons of relationship between different groups of people and some group are at a higher risk than others to develop mental health issues. This article only looks at a few relationships such as location, ethnicity and age so there is many other relationships to explore such as gender, wealth, race etc."

    "text": "COVID-19 Data Brief 2020: Suicides, Suicide Attempts and Suicidal Ideation in Massachusetts\nThis article comes from Mass.gov archive of public health data. It focuses on Suicidiality before and after Covid-19 became prevalent in our lives. Some of topics include: Emergency department visit trends from Jan 2018 to May 2021, Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Attempts of different genders from Jan 2018 to May 2021 and Suicide death trends by month. The data comes from the Massachusetts Syndromic Surveillance Program. The Massachusetts Syndromic Surveillance Program has been collecting data from 100% of emergency department (ED) visits within the state of Massachussetts and real time data is transmitted from ED facilities. From this article, the findings that stuck out to me are as follows:\n\nBetween January and April of 2020, total monthly ED visits declined 50%, ED visits for suicidal ideation declined 34%, and ED visits for suicide attempts declined 28%\nSince April 2020, ED visits across all three syndromes have risen (all reasons for admittance, suicide attempt and ideation)\nfemales under age 25 saw the largest relative increase in ED visits related to suicide since the start of the pandemic\nBetween March and December of 2020, Massachusetts averaged 51 suicide deaths per month, indicating that suicide deaths continued to decline despite an increase in overall poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNationally, suicide rates declined by 2.1% in 2019, but Massachusetts was one of only five states to see a statistically significant decline in suicides between 2018 and 2019\n\nBased on these findings, I can see that the pandemic negatively effected the treatment of any suicide symptoms because people could not or stopped trying to get treatment. Total monthly treatments are down since before the pandemic started which suggests that people are not feeling the need for emergency visits when they still may need them. Mass has done a great job reducing its state level suicide rate but I feel that will increase as time goes on. I would love to do a similar study but for mental health in general."

    "text": "Background\nOne application of analyzing text-as-data that I am particularly interested in is analysis of open-text survey responses. Entities working in the food system development space are beginning to utilize what are becoming known as “community food assessments” more frequently. An important feature of many of these surveys is the open-text response, meaning that respondents can answer the question in their own words. In my experience the analysis of these responses consists of reading through them (or some of them, depending on the number of responses) and perhaps identifying a theme that comes up once or twice or even simply highlighting one or two responses that seemed particularly interesting. Not only is this approach potentially quite misleading, it also likely misses rich, nuanced information. My goal is to learn several methods for analyzing those responses quantitatively."

In this study, 2,056 people responded to the Metro-North Customer Satisfaction survey, answering 58 closed-response questions and a single open-ended question, “If you are not satisfied with our performance in any of the areas in questions 1 through 58, please explain why below. Please also include any other comments or service suggestions.” The researchers then used a Naive Bayes Classifier to label open-ended responses according to the topics created by the forced-choice questions. This seems useful, although perhaps a bit simplistic.\n“Structural Topic Models for Open-Ended Survey Responses”2 examines Structural Topic Models (STM) as a method of analyzing open-ended survey questions. This method allows topics of interest to be discovered in the responses, as opposed to assumed beforehand, and to be analyzed in relation to information about each respondent (such as demographic information). This seems extremely relevant for understanding our food systems, as individuals occupying the same geographic space (e.g. a neighborhood, a zip code, etc.) can perceive and occupy vastly different food systems."

The data for each tweet have the following relevant variables: tweetid (the unique code given to the tweet), userid (the Twitter code of the user that posted that tweet), postdate (the time and day the tweet was posted), latitude, longitude, and message (the body of the tweet).\n\n\n\nWhat methods are used?\n\nVolume analysis and text mining techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis\nLatent Dirichlet allocation was applied for topic modeling to infer the different topics of discussion, and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner was applied for sentiment analysis to determine the overall feelings and attitudes found in the dataset.\n\n\n\nWhat are the findings of the study?\n\nSentiment analysis shows that the overall discussion is negative, especially when users are reacting to political or extreme weather events. Topic modeling shows that the different topics of discussion on climate change are diverse, but some topics are more prevalent than others. In particular, the discussion of climate change in the USA is less focused on policy-related topics than other countries.\n\n\n\nWhat’s your take on it?\n-I thought this article/study was really interesting to read. There were a lot of analyses and graphs for things I hadn’t even thought of before reading it. I thought the differences over time and that the overall discussion of climate change on Twitter is negative were some interesting points. Overall, I think this is a really good article that can be helpful to look back at."

Then, they used a third-party data platform Synthesio to collect English tweets, if the tweet contained at least one preselected hashtag and were posted by US users from August 2018 to January 2021, Synthesio returns data with content-level information such as the tweet content, user-level information such as the Twitter handle and the geolocation information of a user, and the time stamp.\nFor RQ2 - They filtered their Twitter dataset, compiled a list of climate movement actor Twitter handles and filtered the US Twitter discourse dataset to select all tweets that were posted by actors based in the US. The search terms they used to collect news stories from the Media Cloud are climate change, global warming, climate emergency, climate crisis, climate strike, climate protest, and climate march. Media Cloud gathered digital presence (URLs) of these news outlets and then they applied a third-party scraper Zyte to parse all URLs. They chose the news outlets from each respective country according to the source from the Digital News Report 2020 (Newman et al. 2020) as having the highest market share (e.g., weekly usage). In total, 30,669 news stories were included and used for analyses.\n\n\n\nWhat methods are used?\n\nTopic modelling to Identify Major Frames of Climate Strike and Their Evolution (unsupervised topic model algorithm Latent Dirichlet Allocation)\nThe resulting models are compared based on model diagnostics such as coherence score\nNLP to Identify Major Entities in Climate Strike Discourse\n\n\n\nWhat are the findings of the study?\n\nNews outlets tend to report on global politicians’ (in)action toward climate policy, the consequences of climate change, and industry’s response to the climate crisis. Differently, climate movement actors on Twitter advocate for political actions and policy changes as well as addressing the social justice issues surrounding climate change.\nConversations around the climate movement on Twitter are highly politicized, with a substantial number of tweets targeting politicians, partisans, and country actors. These findings contribute to our understanding of how people use social media to frame political issues and collective action, in comparison to the traditional mainstream news outlets.\n\n\n\nWhat’s your take on it?\n\nI thought this paper had a relatively extensive analysis into the comparisons for the research questions presented. This article gives me a lot to think about with designing my own questions, as well as providing more data collection and analysis methods. I thought the conclusions about news outlets and on twitter were both interesting."

They hypothesize these three cultural types based on distinct cultural norms.\nThey propose three “perfect” descriptions for each cultural type, while acknowledging that some societies may be a combination of the types.\nThese were my key takeaways about each type:\n\nDignity: Everybody has individual worth that is not taken away by others’ worth. People tend to be internally driven and law-abiding.\nHonour: People care about how they value themselves, but also how they are valued by society. Themes of tit-for-tat are common.\nFace: Protecting your reputation (as perceived by others) is most important, and social systems are hierarchical. Your face is not taken away by others’, so it is beneficial to collaborate in protecting everyone’s face.\n\nParticipants were white Americans from northern US (dignity), white Americans from southern US and Latinos (honour) and Asian Americans (face). Experiment 1 tested their patterns of reciprocal behaviour, perceptions of worth (external vs. internal) and alignment with honour-related aggression. Experiment 2 extended Experiment 1 by also testing truthfulness and the importance of face. Findings indicated distinct profiles for the three cultural types based on the tested dimensions.\nMy thoughts: A lot of theoretical details were presented in an abstract manner that made this paper challenging to follow. However, the way they operationalised their argument was fascinating and has led to lots of interesting research in this area."

    "text": "Wilkerson & Casas (2017)\nThis was one of our assigned readings for this week, but it ended up being useful for my post. Before describing their own study, they first provide a useful summary of the stages of quantitative text analysis: how to obtain your data, transform it to quantitative data, analyse it (through both statistical and text analysis methods) and validate it. They describe new methods in the field, such as unsupervised learning to explore datasets and sentiment analysis.\nAfter mentioning some challenges in topic modelling (e.g., no ideal method of validation, topics unstable across iterations), they provide their own example of using topic modelling to uncover common topics in >9,000 US government speeches, and whether these differ between the Democratic and Republican parties.\nThey briefly describe how they pre-processed the data and transformed it into a quantitative format (1 row = 1 speech, 1 column = presence of 1 feature/word). They made 17 versions of topic models with 850 topics, then used cosine similarities to uncover the most common topics. These were then grouped into broader topic categories called meta-topics. 1 metatopic that they were unable to interpret clearly was excluded. For their analysis, “more clusters improve(d) overall fit until approximately 50 clusters” (Wilkerson & Casas, 2017, p. 538).\nThey then mention steps taken to ensure that the speeches within each topic model conform to it – I am unsure if this was done manually/automatically, and do not fully understand this portion. Could we go over it in class?\nBy working through the exercise above, they propose “similarity of estimates of topic emphasis across different models” (Wilkers & Casas, 2017, p. 539) as a good way to validate topic modelling.\nMy thoughts: This paper was harder to read than the first one, given my unfamiliarity with topic modelling. I hope that as we discuss more text analytic methods in class, I will have a better understanding of this paper and how I can employ similar methods to extract topics from corpora."

What are the findings of the study? Romo, LK study found significant negative effects on physical and mental issues, such as depression, on participants with health-related financial uncertainty. Participants worried about the cost of seeking care and the financial burden of receiving such care. This study found that effective communication to participants help manage this financial uncertainty, including sharing information, social networking and establishing emotional support. TrellisRx found numerous misperceptions between health systems and health payors. This is especially useful in finding common ground between these two systems. The studies found that both parties have a common objective of improving health outcomes and ensuring patient access and affordability to access quality care. It is very interesting that both parties have a lot of common ground, including an agreement that the rising cost of drugs in unsustainable."

    "text": "My research idea\nThe emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the surge of the Great Reshuffle, with many people rethinking their career paths and personal life trajectories. Because the quarantines, lockdowns and self-imposed isolation limited interpersonal communication in most offline settings, people have turned to social networking sites to communicate their feelings and thoughts about the changes in their work-life interface. With the unprecedented number of employees being forced to work from home, the stigma that remote work was less productive has diminished (Barrero et al., 2021). A survey from LinkedIn (2021) suggests that when considering a job opportunity, the most important factor for people across 200 countries was work-life balance. The desire for flexible work options has increased by 12.3% since the beginning of the pandemic, making it the fastest-growing priority among job candidates on LinkedIn. While the increasing demand for flexible working arrangements has received much attention from different stakeholders and segments of the society, it remains largely unclear how the collective perception about remote work has changed so rapidly and the extent to which it is associated with people’s shared experiences about work-life role integration in the digital sphere. This research focuses on examining the influence of digital emotion transmission in the phase of shared role integration. Drawn on the literature on emotional contagion (Hatfield et al., 1993) and micro-role transitions (Ashforth et al. 2000), we suggest that the disruptive changes during the pandemic made one’s work-life boundary more permeable and flexible than that prior to the pandemic. As a result, remote workers were likely to engage in an increasing number of micro-role transitions. In the absence of mental scripts for such transitions, people were more likely to share their experiences about their daily episodes of role interruptions and boundary work online. Because emotional content tends to be promoted in digital platforms, users of these platforms are likely be exposed to others’ affective expressions with a high level of frequency and intensity (Goldenberg & Gross, 2020). As such, feelings about work-life role integration are likely to spread and gradually become convergent among those platform users. This research will leverage sentiment analysis to reveal how people’s emotional expressions of remote work have changed during the pandemic as well as to uncover the trajectory of digital emotion contagion patterns.\n#Research question\nHow the collective perception about remote work has changed so rapidly and the extent to which it is associated with people’s shared experiences about work-life role integration in the digital sphere.\n#Data source\ntwitter dataset from 2019-2022, with key words such as remote work, work from home in US.\nThe prior study has demonstrated the high frequency of tweets related to remote work from March 2020, indicting twitter users were actively discussing remote work online. Thus, we plan to use sentiment analysis to analyze people’s perception towards remote work, whether it is positive or negative and the process of collective emotion. We will also apply topic modeling to reveal what main topics of remote work people share online.\n#Reference:\nStanisław Wrycza & Jacek Maślankowski (2020) Social Media Users’ Opinionson Remote Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
